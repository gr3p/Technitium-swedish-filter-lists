Any new filters should be added to `main.txt`.

Then run `sort.sh` to split and sort the filters into extended, non-extended, and ppd-filters.

* extended = Filters that are specifically written for uBlock Origin.
* non-extended = Standard Adblock Plus compatible filters.
* ppd-filters = [Pre-parsing directives](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#pre-parsing-directives).
